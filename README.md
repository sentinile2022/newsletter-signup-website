# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form 

![Design preview for the Newsletter sign-up form with success message coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a frontend mentor project done using javascript and tailwind css.

# My experience

This project was quite simple but it has taught me a lot of things:

- how to read and use regex to check for patterns (such as validating the email like in this project)
- how to use chatGPT to generate code (e.g. for the tailwind config file rather than inputing everything manually)
- how to use chatGPT in general to ask any queries
- how to implement responsive design in a better way (something I struggled with before the project)
- why TailwindCSS is so legendary (this one is contraversial)
